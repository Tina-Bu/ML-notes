# Sequence Models
Write the equation describing a dynamical system. Can you unfold it? Now, can you use this to describe a RNN?
What determines the size of an unfolded graph?
What are the advantages of an unfolded graph?
What does the output of the hidden layer of a RNN at any arbitrary time t represent?
Are the output of hidden layers of RNNs lossless? If not, why?
RNNs are used for various tasks. From a RNNs point of view, what tasks are more demanding than others?
Discuss some examples of important design patterns of classical RNNs.
Write the equations for a classical RNN where hidden layer has recurrence. How would you define the loss in this case? What problems you might face while training it?
What is backpropagation through time?
Consider a RNN that has only output to hidden layer recurrence. What are its advantages or disadvantages compared to a RNN having only hidden to hidden recurrence?
What is Teacher forcing? Compare and contrast with BPTT.
What is the disadvantage of using a strict teacher forcing technique? How to solve this?
Explain the vanishing/exploding gradient phenomenon for recurrent neural networks.
Why donâ€™t we see the vanishing/exploding gradient phenomenon in feedforward networks?
What is the key difference in architecture of LSTMs/GRUs compared to traditional RNNs?
What is the difference between LSTM and GRU?
Explain Gradient Clipping.
Adam and RMSProp adjust the size of gradients based on previously seen gradients. Do they inherently perform gradient clipping? If no, why?
Discuss RNNs in the context of Bayesian Machine Learning.
Can we do Batch Normalization in RNNs? If not, what is the alternative?
