# Common ML Interview Questions & How to Answer Them

Maybe you are looking for a job in the machine learning field. To level up your interview skills, there are generally 2 options - practice advice from experienced engineers or read a 3-min Medium article written by one person who has done a few interviews. If you prefer option 1 you are in the wrong place.  

If you stayed, I assume you decided to go with option 2 (no judgments). I summarized all the different ML interview topics I was personally asked and some resources to prepare for them. 

The motivation for this post comes from my personally frustration during job hunting. Data science job descriptions are so poorly written . Jeremie Harris
 wrote and I quote, if someone is looking for 6+ years experience of deep learning they are basically asking for Geoffrey Hinton’s entourage. [https://towardsdatascience.com/the-problem-with-data-science-job-postings-8a3542f38724][1]
