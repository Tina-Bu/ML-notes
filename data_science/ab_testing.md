### Hypothesis Testing | A/B Testing

- We can interpret data by assuming a specific structure our outcome and use statistical methods to confirm or reject the assumption. The assumption is called a hypothesis and the statistical tests used for this purpose are called statistical hypothesis tests.
- The assumption of a statistical test is called the null hypothesis, or hypothesis 0 (H0 for short).
- The strength of evidence in support of a null hypothesis is measured by the **P-value**
	- **If p-value \> alpha**: Fail to reject the null hypothesis (i.e. not signifiant result).
	- **If p-value \<= alpha**: Reject the null hypothesis (i.e. significant result).
- steps
	- choose and characterize metric to evaluate your experiment
		- sanity check: invariant metrics, things that shouldnâ€™t change across control and treatment groups
		- sums and counts
		- distribution: mean, median, percentiles
		- probability and rates: click-through rate
		- ratios
	- choose 
		- significance level (alpha)
		- statistical power (1-beta)
		- practical significance level: you really want to launch the change
	- calculate required sample size
	- take sample for control/treatment groups
	- run the test
	- analyze results
