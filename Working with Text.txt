# Working with Text: Beyond Word Clouds and Experiments with NLP

Talk by Anna Nicanorova (Vice President, Engineering at Annalect) at WCAI conference workshop on 05/15/2019

## Workshop Overview

A big part of the data and some may say, the most interesting data is unstructured text: news articles, blog posts, emails, Twitter posts, log files, and countless other publications. While in the last couple of years we have made amazing progress in algorithmic analysis and display of quantitative data, unfortunately there are few data visualizations that help us work with pure text besides the notorious work clouds.

This tutorial will provide an overview of the latest algorithms and techniques for text analysis and summarization, and will cover the more original and interesting strategies to visualize a document or a group of documents.

## Notes

Word cloud: only visualization for NLP, not very informative
Alternatives:
- SANKEY diagram from ngram
- Word networks

### Analytics method/algorithms

- Text summarization
- info highlight (sparkling)
- topic modeling
- speech recognition
- translation
- LDA: need to specify \#topics and creative names
- understanding language, sarcasm, jokes, context

- Solved
	- sapm detection
	- part of speech tagging
	- name entity recognition
- kind of solved
	- sentiment analysis
	- machine translation
	- information extraction - AL assistant
	- word sense disambiguation: which "mouse"?
- solving
	- summarization
	- dialogue
	- paraphrasing
	- question & answer
